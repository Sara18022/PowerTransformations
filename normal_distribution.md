Mean : The mean is the central tendency of the normal distribution. It defines the location of the peak for the bell curve. Most values cluster around the mean.

Standard Deviation : The standard deviation is a measure of variability. It determines how far away from the mean the values tend to fall. It represents the typical distance between the observations and the average.

Note : In a normal distribution, mean = median = mode

here are many data transformation techniques that can be used to normalize or alter the distribution of a dataset. These include Log transformation, Square root transformation, Power transformation, Exponential transformation e.t.c. The Box-Cox transformation is useful in data normalization because it can help to reduce the impact of outliers, and can make the data more consistent and comparable.

The pattern of values obtained when a variable is measured in large number of individuals is called a distribution. The normal distribution, also known as the Gaussian distribution, is a continuous probability distribution that is widely used in Machine Learning and statistical modeling. It is a bell-shaped curve that is symmetrical around its mean and is characterized by its mean and standard deviation. This is called normal distribution as most of the biological parameters (such as weight, height and blood sugar) follow it. 

The aim of normalization is to change the distribution of the observation such that it resembles a Normal or Gaussian distribution. A Gaussian distribution is a probability distribution that is symmetric and bell-shaped. Most of the data is concentrated near the mean, with fewer and fewer data points as you move away from the mean.
